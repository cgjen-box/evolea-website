## A paradigm shift

The understanding of social skills for people on the autism spectrum has fundamentally changed.

### Historical perspective

Early autism research prioritized diagnostic markers like language and repetitive behaviors. Social skills were treated as secondary rather than essential. Training focused narrowly on surface-level skills like eye contact and basic politeness.

### The current approach

Modern perspectives recognize social skills as fundamental to development. They include:

- Self-advocacy
- Relationships in different contexts
- Daily living skills
- Digital competence
- Exploring personal identity

### The future

The field is moving toward greater individualization and participation. The focus is on relevance to each person's real-life circumstances. Neurodivergent perspectives on social interaction are included instead of imposing standardized expectations.

At EVOLEA we create spaces where children on the spectrum can develop authentically and lead self-determined lives.
