## What are executive functions?

Executive functions are cognitive abilities that help people solve problems and reach goals. They form the invisible steering wheel in our brain.

### The four core areas

**1. Brain Fluency**
- Working memory
- Processing speed

**2. Brain Organization**
- Planning
- Prioritization

**3. Brain Flexibility**
- Perspective shifts
- Task switching

**4. Brain Control**
- Self-monitoring
- Emotion regulation

### Practical support strategies

Many parents and professionals who support children on the spectrum know these situations. Here are practical strategies in five core areas:

**Flexibility**
- Use visual routines
- Announce changes in advance

**Self-regulation**
- Use social stories
- Offer quiet zones

**Impulse control**
- Token reward systems
- Visualize clear rules

**Planning and organization**
- Break tasks into small steps
- Use checklists

**Problem solving**
- Model strategies
- Celebrate successes

### Measuring progress

We recommend measurable, positively phrased goals to track progress. Celebrating successes strengthens children's confidence.
