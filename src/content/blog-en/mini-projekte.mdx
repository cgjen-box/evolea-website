## Closing the gap

Where can my child find a leisure group where they feel comfortable? Many parents ask this question.

Most programs are designed for neurotypical children. Children with autism or ADHD often remain socially isolated.

### Our approach

EVOLEA addresses this problem through structured 90-minute sessions with a consistent flow:

1. **Welcome** - Arrival and orientation
2. **Daily goal** - Set clear expectations
3. **Active phase** - Working together
4. **Reflection** - What did we learn?
5. **Closing ritual** - Safe transition

This predictability reduces anxiety and builds confidence.

### Mini Restaurant - our first project

**Start:** October 2025

**Participants:** Maximum of eight children with three professionals

**What children learn:**
- Plan menus
- Create shopping lists
- Measure ingredients
- Prepare and serve a meal for parents

This approach combines practical skills with social interaction. At the same time it gives parents a break and short consultation conversations.

### More than leisure

We create spaces where children can try things safely. Leisure is not just recreation, but essential developmental learning.
