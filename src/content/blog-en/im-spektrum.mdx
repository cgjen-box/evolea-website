## Language shapes perception

At EVOLEA we deliberately use "im Spektrum" instead of the anglicized "auf dem Spektrum". This wording reflects our organizational values.

### Why "im" instead of "auf"?

"Im" suggests spatial inclusion and depth, rather than placing individuals on a linear scale.

The phrase is often translated directly. But German can do more.

### Our conceptual model

We describe our model as circular rather than linear. Autism is multidimensional with interconnected traits - not a severity gradient.

### Beyond autism

This framing intentionally extends to neurodivergent conditions in general:
- ADHD
- Dyslexia
- Tourette syndrome

We emphasize shared experiences and mutual learning among community members.

### Language as foundation

Language choices shape perception. Language is foundational to our mission to create inclusive spaces for children on the spectrum.

At EVOLEA we choose our words with care - because language is the first step toward inclusion.
