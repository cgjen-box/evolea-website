## EVOLEA is officially founded

We are pleased to announce the founding of EVOLEA as a nonprofit association. EVOLEA is dedicated to educational programs for neurodivergent children. Our initiative focuses on creating spaces where children can develop - for children on the autism spectrum and with ADHD.

### Our core values

- **Structured** - Clear processes and expectations
- **Warm** - A welcoming, safe space
- **Professional** - Evidence-based methods
- **Measurable** - Traceable progress

### Our programs

**Already active:**
- Mini Garden - kindergarten preparation program

**Starting soon:**
- Mini Projects - social skills groups
- Mini Restaurant - first project, starting late October for children ages 5-8, with a focus on social skills

### Our vision

Long-term goal: founding our own school

### Become part of EVOLEA

There are many ways to get involved:
- Membership in the association
- Volunteer work
- Donations
- Inquiries to hello@evolea.ch

Together we support the development of neurodivergent children and relieve families through our nonprofit, mission-driven work.
