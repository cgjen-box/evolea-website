## A space for parents

EVOLEA is launching a monthly virtual gathering designed for parents of children on the autism spectrum. We know that caregivers often experience a significant emotional burden that is not sufficiently recognized.

### Our goal

Cafe EVOLEA creates a space where parents can share valuable insights from professionals on topics they choose, while building community connections in a relaxed atmosphere.

### Format and flow

Each session consists of two components:
- Expert presentations followed by Q&A
- Informal group discussions in breakout rooms

### First session

- **When:** Wednesday, October 1, 2025, 20:00-21:30
- **Where:** Online via Zoom
- **Topic:** Introducing the organization
- **What you need:** Internet access and your favorite drink
- **Registration:** Not required

At EVOLEA we create spaces where children on the spectrum can thrive and pursue self-determined, fulfilling paths.

We look forward to seeing you!
