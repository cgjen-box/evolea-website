## The rewards debate

This article examines the debate about reward systems in parenting and references Alfie Kohn's influential work, which describes incentives as counterproductive.

### What the research shows

Research shows nuanced results:

- **External rewards can reduce enthusiasm for activities children already enjoy**
- **They can be effective motivators** for tasks children do not like

### Recommendations for practice

**When to use rewards:**
- Only when intrinsic motivation is missing
- Not for prosocial behavior

**How to use rewards:**
- Give immediate feedback
- Use material incentives sparingly
- Distinguish between true reward systems and attempts to bribe

### Particular effectiveness for ADHD

Research shows particular effectiveness for children with ADHD, where structured reward systems can have clear positive effects.

### Reframing the central question

The key insight reframes the parental question: not whether rewards should be used, but when and how they can be applied strategically.
