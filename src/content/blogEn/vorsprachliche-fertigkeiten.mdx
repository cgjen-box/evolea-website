## Communication begins before the first word

Communication begins long before the first spoken word. Language grows out of early social and communicative experiences, not in isolation.

### The ten most important preverbal skills

1. **Environmental awareness** - Attention to the environment
2. **Turn-taking interactions** - Reciprocal exchange
3. **Sustained attention** - Being able to keep focus
4. **Joint attention** - Shared focus on objects
5. **Symbolic play** - Imagination and pretend
6. **Word comprehension** - Understanding meanings
7. **Intentional vocalizations** - Producing purposeful sounds
8. **Gesture imitation** - Imitating movements
9. **Pointing** - Indicating things
10. **Social initiation** - Making contact

### Building the bridge to language

A central concern for many parents: strengthening these foundational skills builds the bridge to language rather than delaying language development.

### Special significance for children on the spectrum

Access to social interaction is an important consideration in the developmental journey. At EVOLEA we create spaces where children on the spectrum can thrive independently and with satisfaction.
