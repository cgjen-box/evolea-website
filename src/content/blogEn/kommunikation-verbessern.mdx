## Evidence-based communication strategies

This article presents three evidence-based strategies to support language development in children on the autism spectrum.

### 1. Joint attention and naming

Looking at something together with your child and naming it builds joint attention, a foundation for language development.

Research shows that children improve their language skills through daily, intentional practice.

### 2. Visual communication tools

Use pictures, simple symbols, or tablets with speech output to help children express themselves when verbal communication is limited.

These tools enable communication even without spoken words and can even foster language development.

### 3. Structured short play sessions

Just ten minutes a day of focused parent engagement, where you follow the child's interests and use simple language, leads to measurable vocabulary gains.

### The most important point

Parents do not need to be specialists. Everyday practices like shared observation, visual supports, and mindful play support development effectively.
