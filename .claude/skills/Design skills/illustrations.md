## Core Principles

1. **Real Photos First**: AI images are ONLY for illustrations, not real content
2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Swiss/Central European context, no religious symbols
3. **Neurodiversity-Affirming**: Celebrate differences, avoid deficit framing
4. **Brand Consistency**: Use EVOLEA colors, butterfly motifs, spectrum aesthetic
5. **Always Generate 2 Options**: Let the user choose the best fit

```

### Program Heroes (DALL-E versions)

Show 3-4 diverse children working together on an art project at a table in a bright, welcoming classroom.
